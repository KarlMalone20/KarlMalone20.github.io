		<p><strong><a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beihang University</a> (previously known as Beijing
			University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)</strong> was founded on October 25, 1952 under the name of Beijing
			Institute of Aeronautics, originating from the merger of the aeronautical departments of Tsinghua University,
			Beiyang University, Xiamen University, Sichuan University, etc. Located in the center of the Zhongguancun Science
			Park and within easy reach of central Beijing, Beihang is the first university in China focusing on aeronautical
			and astronautical education and research. About 26km away from the main campus, the suburban Shahe campus provides
			quiet study milieu and is also home to the National Laboratory of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NLAA). The very
			new Doudian campus aims at research and innovation through engineering combined with medicine. </p>

			<p><a href="https://bme.buaa.edu.cn/" target="_blank">The School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering (BSME) </a>
			at Beihang University was established on October 23, 2008, originating from the Department of Bioengineering
			that was initiated in January 2002. Since its opening, BSME has grown and evolved at a rapid pace and now plays
			an important role in the development of biomedical studies and education throughout China. </p>

        <h3>--Teacher Zhang Research group--</h3>
			<p><a href="https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/zhangyb/zh_CN/index.htm" target="_blank">Associate researcher Zhang Yongbiao </a>
			is committed to using multi-omics methods to reveal the etiology of major
			diseases and high-frequency rare diseases and develop molecular diagnostic markers, and reveal the symmetrical
			development mechanism of the body based on neural crest cell developmental disorders. He has presided over a
			number of National Natural Science Foundation of China projects and published more than 20 SCI papers in journals
			such as Nature Communication and Human Molecular Genetics. The research group mainly uses high-throughput sequencing
			combined with gene editing technology to explore the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and birth defects.
			The main research directions include 1) developing new technologies and methods for multi-omics research based
			on high-throughput sequencing; 2) focusing on major Diseases and high-frequency rare diseases, analyze their
			pathogenesis, and develop molecular markers that can be used for diagnosis and treatment; 3) Research on the
			mechanism of symmetrical development of the body based on disease models. </p>
